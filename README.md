# CoordinateSystems
Coordinate Systems project for the Algorithms and Programming course.

## Scope
Building a coordinate system program that is able to register a new point for the origin of a plane and take in other points, also registered by the user, and in the end of the registration it returns the newly registered coordinates position in each of the four quadrants, and also returns the number of points in the quadrant, the most distant and nearest points. The second part simulates the movement of a ficticious robot in a plane that is disjointed from the previous one. The robots follows a set of instructions predetermined by the project interacting with the user only by taking as input the number of steps that it will take. By the end, the program computes the new position that the robot assumes.
